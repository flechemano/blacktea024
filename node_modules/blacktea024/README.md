# Black Tea Supply Chain Management dApp

## Overview

The Black Tea Supply Chain Management dApp is a decentralized application (dApp) built on blockchain technology to revolutionize the tea industry's supply chain. This dApp aims to bring transparency, traceability, and fair trade practices to the tea market by leveraging the power of blockchain.

## Features

- **Transparency:** Consumers can trace the journey of their tea from cultivation to consumption, ensuring authenticity and quality assurance.
- **Traceability:** Tea producers can track each step of the production process, including harvesting, processing, and packaging, on the immutable blockchain ledger.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated smart contracts facilitate secure and transparent transactions between tea producers, distributors, and consumers, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.
- **Token Economy:** Implement a token economy to incentivize sustainable farming practices among tea producers and reward consumers for participating in the ecosystem.
- **Marketplace:** Provide a decentralized marketplace where consumers can purchase tea directly from producers using cryptocurrency, promoting fair trade and empowering small-scale farmers.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain:** Utilize blockchain technology for its immutable ledger, decentralized consensus mechanism, and smart contract functionality.
- **Ethereum:** Leverage the Ethereum blockchain for its robust smart contract capabilities and widespread adoption in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
- **Solidity:** Develop smart contracts using Solidity, a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Web3.js:** Interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts from the frontend using Web3.js, a JavaScript library for Ethereum development.
- **React:** Build the frontend user interface using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive web applications.
- **IPFS:** Store off-chain data, such as images and documents related to tea production, on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized and censorship-resistant storage.
