## Overview
A decentralized application (dApp) built on blockchain technology to facilitate trustless trading of tokens.
## Features
- **Token Trading:** Users can trade various Ethereum-based tokens in a decentralized and trustless manner.
- **Decentralized:** The application operates without a central authority, providing users with full control over their funds.
- **Smart Contracts:** Trading is facilitated by smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.
- **Web3 Integration:** Interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts from the frontend using Web3.js, enabling seamless integration with decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets.
## Technologies Used
- **Ethereum:** Utilize the Ethereum blockchain for token trading and smart contract execution.
- **Solidity:** Develop smart contracts using Solidity, a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Web3.js:** Interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts from the frontend using Web3.js, a JavaScript library for Ethereum development.
- **Node.js:** Build the backend server using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** Create RESTful APIs for interacting with the server using Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js.
